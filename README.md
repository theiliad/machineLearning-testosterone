# machineLearning-testosterone
A very basic piece of python code that sets up machine learning for a table of data

This was the first project I made with Scikit, very small but good for a start!

After seeing these series from Google:

I decided to go ahead and make it one more time!

<b>Please Note: </b> The dataset that you need to have for a machine learning program must be much larger than this for the predictions to be more precise!
